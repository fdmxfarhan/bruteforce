# Password Toolkit: Generator & Brute-Forcer

This project contains two Python scripts: a powerful password generator to create custom wordlists and a simple brute-force script to test login credentials.

---

## Password Generator (`password-generator.py`)

This script generates a list of password combinations based on a given set of words. It creates variations using different cases, separators, and common suffixes.

### How It Works

The script takes a list of base words and generates permutations of those words. For each permutation, it creates several variants:
- **Separators**: Joins words with `_`, `-`, `.`, or no separator.
- **Case Variations**: `lower`, `UPPER`, `Capitalized`, and original case.
- **Suffixes**: Appends common suffixes like `!`, `@`, `123`, `2024`, etc.

The final list is saved to `generated_passwords.txt`.

### Usage

1.  **Customize Words**: Open `password-generator.py` and modify the `words` list with your target keywords.
    ```python
    words = ['admin', '123', 'user']
    ```
2.  **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python password-generator.py
    ```
3.  **Get the Wordlist**: A file named `generated_passwords.txt` will be created with the generated passwords.

## Login Brute-Forcer (`bruteforce.py`)

This script attempts to log into a web service by iterating through a wordlist of passwords.

### Configuration

Before running, you need to configure the script in `bruteforce.py`:

1.  **URL**: Set the `url` variable to the target login page.
    ```python
    url = "https://rrlco.ir/users/login"
    ```
2.  **Username**: Set the `username` you want to test.
    ```python
    username = "fdmxfarhan@yahoo.com"
    ```
3.  **Wordlist**: Specify the path to your password file. You can use the one generated by the other script.
    ```python
    wordlist_file = "passwords.txt" # or "generated_passwords.txt"
    ```

### How to Run

Execute the script from your terminal:
```bash
python bruteforce.py
```

The script will print each attempt and notify you if a successful login is detected.
